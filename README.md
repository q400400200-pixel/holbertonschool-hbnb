# HBnB – UML Design (Part 1) 

## Overview
This repository contains **Part 1** of the **HBnB Project**, which focuses on **system analysis and UML design**.  
The main objective of this phase is to model the system architecture and interactions **before implementation**.

---

## Objectives
- Understand system requirements
- Design the system using **UML diagrams**
- Identify system components and their relationships
- Define actors and interactions
- Prepare a solid foundation for future development phases

---

## Actors
The system includes the following actors:

- **User**
  - Registers and logs into the system
  - Searches for places
  - Views place details
  - Writes reviews
  - Rates places

- **Host**
  - Manages owned places
  - Adds, updates, and deletes place listings
  - Views reviews related to their places

- **Administrator**
  - Manages users and system data
  - Oversees system integrity
  - Handles inappropriate content

---

## UML Diagrams
The following UML diagrams are included in this phase:

- **Use Case Diagram**
- **Class Diagram**
- **Sequence Diagram**
- **Package Diagram**

These diagrams describe the structure and behavior of the HBnB system.

## Tools Used
- UML Modeling Tools (e.g. Mermaid.js)
- Git & GitHub
